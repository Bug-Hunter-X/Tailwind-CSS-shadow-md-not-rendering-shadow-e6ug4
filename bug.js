```javascript
//SomeComponent.js
<div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Some Component</h2>
  <p>This is some component content.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  The issue arises when the `shadow-md` utility class isn't rendering a shadow, even though all other classes work as expected.
